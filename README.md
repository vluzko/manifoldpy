This repo, in particular the API, is no longer being maintained. Manifold now releases full [data dumps](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#trade-history-dumps), which are *much* easier to work with than the API. I am still happy to review PRs.

Tools for analyzing [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/home) data. Currently has bindings for their API, and code for computing various accuracy metrics (Brier score, log score, calibration).

## Calibration
This is the most recent calibration graph for Manifold Markets. Markets with less than 4 unique traders are excluded. The calibration is generated from the probability *halfway* between market open and market close.

## Installation
The package is on PyPI as [`manifoldpy`](https://pypi.org/project/manifoldpy/). It can be installed with:
```
pip install manifoldpy
```

However, you may want to install the most up-to-date version from github instead if you encounter any issues: 
```
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/vluzko/manifoldpy/tarball/main
```

## Basic Usage
Get a list containing every market:
```
from manifoldpy import api
markets = api.get_all_markets()
```

Manifold also has a POST API that lets you make/resolve/bet on markets. This requires you to have an API key (which you can generate on your [Manifold profile page](https://manifold.markets/profile)). Here's an example for making a bet on a binary market:
```
from manifoldpy import api
# Amount to spend
amount = 100
# The ID of the market to bet on
contract_id = "8Lt9ZTHCPCK58gtn0Y8n"
# The outcome you want to bet on.
outcome = "YES"
api.make_bet(YOUR_API_KEY, amount, contract_id, outcome)
```
If you want to avoid passing the key every time, you can instead create an `APIWrapper` and use that:
```
from manifoldpy import api
wrapper = api.APIWrapper(YOUR_API_KEY)
amount = 100
contract_id = "8Lt9ZTHCPCK58gtn0Y8n"
outcome = "YES"
wrapper.make_bet(amount, contract_id, outcome)
```

Get a market's history of probabilities:
```
from manifoldpy import api
market = api.get_market("market_id")
times, probabilities = market.probability_history()
```

Generate a basic calibration graph:
```
from manifoldpy import api, calibration
full_markets = api.get_full_markets()
binary = [
    m for m in full_markets if isinstance(m, api.BinaryMarket) and m.isResolved
]
df, histories = calibration.build_dataframe(binary)

yes_markets = df[df["resolution"] == "YES"]
no_markets = df[df["resolution"] == "NO"]

# Calibration at start
yes_probs = yes_markets["start"]
no_probs = no_markets["start"]
calibration = calibration.market_set_accuracy(yes_probs, no_probs)
```

There are additional examples for analyzing market calibration in the `scripts/` directory.
